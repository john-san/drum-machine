## Project #3/6: Build a Drum Machine

**Summary:** This is a drum machine built with React.  It allows users click or press keyboard buttons to play the drum machine.  Users can use the settings to adjust the volume, switch the bank for different sounds, or turn off the machine.

**How to use**:

1. Download the project files and extract the folder to your computer.
2. Navigate to the project directory via the terminal and run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.  A browser window will open to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) where you'll be able to view and use the app.

**Things I learned**:
1. How to combine React's useState hook with React's context API.
2. How to use React's useRef hook to target specific React Dom eleents.
3. How to add event listeners using a [custom hook library](https://github.com/donavon/use-event-listener).
